			<h1 class="tenpct-header">In the middle of 2019, I made a commitment to give away <span>10% of my (pre-tax) income</span> for the rest of my life.</h1>
			
			<p>Speaking publicly about this kind of thing makes me extremely uncomfortable. Blabbing about one&rsquo;s charity has always seemed horribly gauche to me, and whenever I see a billionaire put their name on a building, I assume one of two things:</p>
			
			<ol>
			  <li>Imbuing a semi-permanent edifice with their name gives them a false sense of immortality and allows them to ignore the gnawing awareness of their inevitable death for a few minutes longer.</li>
			  <li>The building represents a giant phallus and they're basically just doing the real estate version of swinging their big dick around in front of everyone.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<div class="footnote-container">
        <p>The thought of talking about this kind of thing seeming like bragging, or like I&rsquo;m trying to virtue signal about what a good person I am, makes me squirm<span class="footnote-marker">1</span>. Which is why I haven&rsquo;t spoken about this publicly until now. I don&rsquo;t even think most of my friends know.</p>
      
        <p class="footnote footnote-1"><span>1.</span> Perhaps one day a plaid-sweatered therapist will pay for his beach house helping me figure out why I&rsquo;m incredibly shy about divulging my good deeds, yet will share my most shameful and embarrassing stories to near-strangers with minimal prompting and wild abandon.</p>
      </div>
			
			<p>But I was finally convinced to swallow my discomfort and go public with this by an argument made by the <a href="https://ea-foundation.org/">Effective Altruism Foundation</a>, whose approach to giving has heavily influenced me, and about whom you&rsquo;ll hear more later.</p>
			
			<p>They argue that one of the best things we can do is prosletyze our philanthropy, based on a simple argument. I&rsquo;ll probably never start donating 20% of my income, and I certainly won&rsquo;t ever start donating 100%. But I probably could convince nine other people in my same income bracket to make my same 10% commitment.</p>
			
			<p>Based on that leverage, prosletyzing is probably the highest-impact thing I can do.</p>
						
			<p>In this essay, I&rsquo;m going to explain why I made this commitment, and why I think it&rsquo;s something most people should do. I&rsquo;ll also step through the mechanics of how I do it, and tell you about some of the unexpected benefits I&rsquo;ve found from this practice.</p>
			
			<div class="footnote-container">
			  <p>And, of course, this is also a way for me to hold myself accountable: every year, I&rsquo;ll update this page with the latest information on how much I donated, where I donated it to, and how much of a morally superior person I am for doing something so selfless<span class="footnote-marker">2</span>.</p>
			  <p class="footnote footnote-2"><span>2.</span> Just kidding about that last part, which I reaaalllly hope I didn&rsquo;t have to spell out in this footnote for you.</p>
